# CurseModpackSearch

This is a quick app I made for searching modpacks on Twitch, because Twitch only allows 1 category at a time.

## Usage:
1. Check the categories you want
2. Cross the ones you don't
3. Enter the number of modpacks to be searched
4. Press search.

## Other info:
Maximum of 5 categories is supported, because Twitch doesn't allow for more in one modpack.
The ordering is by popularity.
